# PlainDAQ
An Open Source DAQ module for Raspberry Pi Pico

PlainDAQ is a simple, yet useful DAQ module for your Raspberry Pi Pico. It's got 4 analog inputs, a single analog output channel. It can also output Â±5V to power external curcuitry that needs symetrical power supply. It optionally includes a simple UART-to-BLE module for wireless connectivity.
